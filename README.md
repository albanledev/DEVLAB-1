# Website deployment

To deploy our portfolio site, we'll be using vercel, a tool that allows developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision, all with minimal setup.

By associating our github with vercel, we click on ' Add new ' then ' Project ' then your repositorie name. All that remains is to deploy your site with a name in lowercase. Select 'Continue to dashboard' and that's done you can return on your repositorie on Github.

Select next the new link freshly created and click on 'Running checks'. Then you go to the marketplace and get different like imgbot. grab the free open source mode. Select ' Request new optimization ' and you have to commit for seeing the changes. All it remains is to merge your new branch at your main branch.

We will then use zapier to connect our commits on github to a discord channel. Nothing is easier than to follow the steps proposed by the site itself. I personally created another zap in which discord notifies me when I create a new branch.
